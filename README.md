    &bull; Multiplayer <br>
    &bull; Easy to expand upon <br>
    &bull; It includes a lot of comments explaining the code <br>
 </p>
 
 <p>
   <h2><u><b> ‚ô•Ô∏è How to play? / (How it works) - Guessing game </b></u></h3> 
   &bull; As soon as you start, the console will ask your name (and store it in the var myName) <br>
   &bull; When the console knows your name it will ask if you want to play the tutorial (if you say yes it initiates the tut function, else it just moves on to var modeselector)<br>
   &bull; After selecting your game mode, the program starts the specific function (sp, ai or mp) <br>
   &bull; On all the game modes, you will have to choose a difficulty (var level) <br>
   &bull; If you chose sp - You have to find a number that is randomly generated by the computer <br>
   &bull; If you chose ai - You have to find a number before ai those <br>
   &bull; If you chose mp - You have to find a number before your friend <br>
   &bull; After each game, you will be asked if you want to restart (restart_.. functions) or quit <br>
   
   <h2><u><b> ‚ô•Ô∏è How to play? - Snake </b></u></h3> 
   &bull; As soon as you start, a app will pop up with the snake game <br>
   &bull; Use WASD to control the snake <br>
   &bull; Get as many points as possible :) <br>

   <h2><u><b> ‚ô•Ô∏è How to play? - Adventure </b></u></h3> 
   &bull; As soon as you start, you will be asked your name <br>
   &bull; Then just follow along the history and make choices <br>

  </p>
  
   <p>
   <h2><u><b> ‚ô•Ô∏è Coding style </b></u></h3> 
   &bull; There are 2 types of comments (I - Important) and (NI - Not important)) <br>
   &bull; There's 1 line gap between everything, besides if's <br>
   &bull; I like to make a lot of functions, therefor if u want to expand the code is quite easy <br>
